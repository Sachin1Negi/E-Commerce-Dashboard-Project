Steps Followed while creating the whole backend :

1. Wrote config file to connect node.js and mongoDB.
//Since Node v.17 and MongoDB were producing some error : I needed to replace :
//"localhost" with "127.0.0.1" or "0.0.0.0" this is some ipv6 vs ipv4 issue. And came with new Node version only.

2. made user.js file and wrote schema and model. As I am going to use mongoose.
//schema is used for data and datatype validation. Data means the no. and name of columns remains same
//Datatype means the type of data we insert should always remain same. ( like in strings we cannot enter Integer)
//At end exported : model class with passing collection and schema name inside it.
//whenever you need to use model you must use new keyword to make a new object of it and then do stuff.
// module.exports = mongoose.model("collectionName", schemaObjectName);
//Don't forget to use small "m" in mongoose.model and capital S for mongoose.Schema.

3. Made index.js file imported config file :
using :  require("./db/config.js")
//Wrote and Tested Api's with postman 
//Now wrote Api's to check connection between node.js and mongoDB.
