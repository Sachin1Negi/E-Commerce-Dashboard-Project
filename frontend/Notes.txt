Notes :

1. You must save all the files so that the changes are reflected on the react app else they will show previous result and you'll think things are not working.
2. putting brackets on () a function written inside the onClick={} event causes abnormality. you shoudl not write the brackets inside it.
example : onClick={ collectData} -> right 
          onClick={ collectData()} -> wrong, causes abnormality.
